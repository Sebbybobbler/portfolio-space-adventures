# Space Adventures

This project replicates the front end of a space travel booking site. I utilised flexbox, tables and responsive design during the implementation.

* Project to showcase/practice front-end development in html & CSS.
* This project lets individuals plan solar-system travel, or at the very least see what booking one would look like!
* This project taught me a lot about responsive design and I learned how to better utilise flexbox elements.
